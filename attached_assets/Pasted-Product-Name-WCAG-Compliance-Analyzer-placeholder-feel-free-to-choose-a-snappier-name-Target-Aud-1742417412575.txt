Key Features
1. URL Input
Description: Users enter a website URL via a simple homepage input field to initiate a scan.
Requirements:
Validate URL format (e.g., must include "http://" or "https://").
Free version scans only the submitted URL (single page); paid version offers multi-page or full-site options.
Use a headless browser (e.g., Puppeteer) to render dynamic content, with a 10-second timeout to ensure performance.
2. Automated Scanning
Description: The system analyzes the provided URL for WCAG compliance using automated tools.
Requirements:
Integrate Axe-core with Puppeteer to scan rendered pages, capturing dynamic content (e.g., JavaScript-driven elements).
Evaluate key WCAG criteria, including:
Text alternatives (e.g., missing alt text).
Color contrast ratios.
Keyboard accessibility (e.g., focusable elements).
Heading structure and ARIA landmarks.
Form labels and error handling.
Limit free scans to one page; paid scans can expand to user-defined page sets or full-site crawls (up to 100 pages in premium tiers).
Handle rendering errors gracefully with a retry option and partial results if timeouts occur.
3. Snapshot Overview (Free Version)
Description: Users receive a concise, automated summary of the website’s WCAG compliance after scanning.
Requirements:
Compliance Score: Display a percentage score (e.g., 85%) based on the ratio of passed Axe-core checks to total applicable checks (e.g., 28/30 passed = 93%).
Accompany with a color-coded gauge (green: 80+, yellow: 50-79, red: <50).
Include a disclaimer: “This score reflects automated checks only. Manual review may adjust results.”
Major Issues: Highlight 3-5 critical violations (e.g., “10 images lack alt text,” “Contrast ratio below 4.5:1”) with brief descriptions.
Transparency Note: State limitations: “Automated scans cover detectable issues (est. 20-50% of WCAG criteria). Upgrade for deeper analysis.”
Call-to-Action: Prompt upgrade with “Get Detailed Report” button linking to paid tiers.
4. Detailed Report (Paid Version)
Description: A comprehensive analysis for paid users, enhancing the snapshot with actionable insights.
Requirements:
Full Violation List: Categorize all detected issues by WCAG principle (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust) and level (A, AA, AAA).
Weighted Scoring: Provide a refined score deducting points based on violation severity (e.g., Level A: 5 points, AA: 3 points, AAA: 1 point per instance), with a 100-point base.
Recommendations: Offer specific fixes (e.g., “Add alt=‘Person reading book’ to <img> at line 50”) with code examples.
Prioritization: Flag high-impact issues (e.g., missing form labels) for urgent attention.
Visual Aids: Include screenshots of problematic elements (e.g., low-contrast text) where feasible.
Export Option: Deliver as a downloadable PDF or HTML report.
Scope Expansion: Analyze multiple pages (up to 10 in Basic, 100 in Premium) based on user input or sitemap parsing.
5. User Accounts
Description: Optional accounts to enhance functionality and retention.
Requirements:
Enable registration/login with email or OAuth (e.g., Google).
Store scan history, detailed reports, and subscription details.
Track compliance trends over time for rescanned sites.
Enforce rate limits for free users (e.g., 3 scans/day via IP or account).
6. Additional Paid Features
Description: Differentiate paid tiers with premium offerings.
Requirements:
Full-Site Scanning: Crawl multiple pages (Basic: 10, Premium: 100) using user-defined lists or sitemap parsing.
API Access: Provide a RESTful API for developers to integrate scans into workflows (e.g., CI/CD pipelines).
Manual Review Add-On: Offer expert evaluation for subjective criteria (e.g., alt text quality) as an upsell in Premium tier.
Compliance Badge: Issue a digital badge for sites meeting a threshold (e.g., 90%+ score, manually verified).
Technical Requirements
Frontend
Technologies: React for a responsive, accessible UI.
Features:
URL input field with validation feedback.
Real-time scanning progress bar (e.g., “Analyzing page…”).
Snapshot dashboard with score gauge and issue list.
Detailed report view with collapsible sections for paid users.
Backend
Technologies: Node.js with Express for API and scan orchestration.
Features:
Process URL submissions via a queue system (e.g., Redis or AWS SQS) for scalability.
Execute scans with Puppeteer and Axe-core, handling dynamic content with a 10-second render timeout.
Generate scores and reports, storing results in a database.
Database
Technologies: PostgreSQL for structured storage.
Features:
Save user profiles, scan histories, and subscription statuses.
Index results for quick retrieval in reports and trend tracking.
Scanning Engine
Technologies: Puppeteer + Axe-core.
Process:
Validate and queue URL.
Render page with Puppeteer, waiting up to 10 seconds.
Run Axe-core to detect violations.
Calculate score (pass/fail ratio for free, weighted for paid) and compile results.
Scalability and Performance
Use asynchronous queues to manage scan load, prioritizing paid users.
Optimize Puppeteer instances (e.g., reuse browsers, cap memory) for cost efficiency.
Deploy on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS) with auto-scaling.
Security
Block invalid URLs (e.g., localhost, internal IPs) to prevent abuse.
Apply rate limiting (3 free scans/day per IP or account).
Secure paid features with authentication (e.g., JWT).
Monetization
Freemium Model:
Free Tier: Single-page snapshot with pass/fail score and top issues.
Basic Paid Tier: $10 one-time or $5/month for 10-page scans, detailed reports, and weighted scoring.
Premium Paid Tier: $20/month for full-site scans (100 pages), API access, manual review add-on, and compliance badge.
User Flow
Homepage: User enters URL (e.g., “https://example.com”) and clicks “Scan.”
Free Snapshot: Sees a 93% score (28/30 checks passed), top issues (e.g., “5 missing alt texts”), and a note: “Single-page scan complete. Upgrade for more!”
Upgrade Prompt: “Unlock detailed fixes and multi-page scans” with a payment link.
Paid Report: After subscribing, user selects 10 pages, receives a report with weighted score (e.g., 88/100), prioritized fixes, and export option.
Solutions to Challenges
Automation Limits
Solution: Disclose automation coverage (20-50% of WCAG) in results; offer manual review in Premium tier; provide educational fixes in reports.
Implementation: Add a “Limitations” section in the UI and upsell manual audits.
Dynamic Content
Solution: Use Puppeteer to render pages; cap render time at 10 seconds; handle errors with partial results and retry prompts.
Implementation: Configure Puppeteer with timeouts and test on JavaScript-heavy sites (e.g., React apps).
Scoring System
Solution: Free tier uses pass/fail ratio (e.g., 28/30 = 93%); paid tier uses weighted deductions (e.g., 5/3/1 points per A/AA/AAA violation); include disclaimers for clarity.
Implementation: Build a scoring module in the backend, refine via user feedback.
Scope
Solution: Limit free scans to one page; offer 10-page (Basic) and 100-page (Premium) paid scans; enforce via backend logic and rate limits (3 free/day).
Implementation: Add scope controls in the UI and queue system.
Next Steps
MVP Build: Launch with free single-page scans, pass/fail scoring, and basic UI using React, Node.js, Puppeteer, and Axe-core.
User Testing: Validate with diverse sites (static, dynamic) and refine scoring/UI based on feedback.
Expansion: Add paid tiers, multi-page scans, and manual review after proving demand.
